New features:

* batch operations in SQS (send, receive, delete, change visibility)
* changed `SQSRestServerFactory` to `SQSRestServerBuilder`
* "strict" and "relaxed" modes when creating an SQS server: the limits enforced by SQS are optionally checked, e.g. for batch operations (max 10 messages), maximum message size (64KB). Strict by default.
